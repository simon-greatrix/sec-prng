GARBAGE_COLLECTORY_ENTROPY_DELAY =Use the number of garbage collections and the amount of time this has taken is used as a source of entropy.<br>How long should the collector wait between each sample?
SCHEDULING_ENTROPY_ENABLED = Variation in the actual number of nanoseconds between regular events is taken as entropy.<br>Should this information be collected?
SCHEDULING_ENTROPY_DELAY =Variation in the actual number of nanoseconds between regular events is taken as entropy.<br>How long in millisecondsshould the collector wait between each sample?
THREAD_TIME_ENTROPY_ENABLED =The amount of user and CPU time accumulated by existing threads is taken as a source of entropy.<br>Should this information be collected?
THREAD_TIME_ENTROPY_DELAY =The amount of user and CPU time accumulated by existing threads is taken as a source of entropy.<br>How long in millisecondsshould the collector wait between each sample?
AWT_ENTROPY_ENABLED =The SHA-256 of the pixels of random areas of the screen are taken as a source of entropy.<br>Should this information be collected?
AWT_ENTROPY_DELAY = The SHA-256 of the pixels of random areas of the screen are taken as a source of entropy.<br>How long in milliseconds should the collector wait between each sample?

AWT_ENTROPY_HEIGHT =The SHA-256 of the pixels of random areas of the screen are taken as a source of entropy.<br>How many pixels high should each individual sample area be?
HEAP_ENTROPY_ENABLED =The identity hash code of a newly allocated object is taken as a source of entropy.<br>Should this information be collected?
HEAP_ENTROPY_DELAY =The identity hash code of a newly allocated object is taken as a source of entropy.<br>How long in milliseconds should the collector wait between each sample?
COLLECTOR_SLOW_DOWN=If no entropy is being used up by the PRNGs, collection will slow down to remove load from the system.  Slow down will begin after this duration has passed with no entopy requested. After this duration has passed twice collection will be half the speed. After this duration has passed three times, it will be one third the speed, and so on.
NETWORK_EXPECTED_USAGE=Expected number of times each 128-byte block of network entropy will be used in sourcing 16-byte entropy blocks. This is not the actual number of times a block will be used, only the average.
NETWORK_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=The amount of time to await for a connection to a network source to be established.
NETWORK_READ_TIMEOUT=The amount of time to await for a network source to return some data.
NETWORK_SEEDS_USED=The number of seeds injected into the entropy pool upon each application start-up.
NETWORK_HOTBITS_WEIGHT=The Fourmilab Hot Bits service generates entropy by monitoring the decay of a Krypton-85 sample. How often should this source be used compared to the others? Higher values mean a source is used more often.
NETWORK_QUANTUM_WEIGHT=The Australian National University's service generates entropy by monitoring quantum vacuum fluctuations. How often should this source be used compared to the others? Higher values mean a source is used more often.
NETWORK_RANDOMDOTORG_WEIGHT=The random.org service generates entropy from wireless interference. How often should this source be used compared to the others? Higher values mean a source is used more often.
NETWORK_RANDOMDOTORG_API_KEY=The random.org service requires an API key. If you need more seed information, you may need a different API key.
SEED_STORAGE_CLASS=How seed data is stored\: in a file, in system preferences, or in user preferences.
SEED_STORAGE_PERIOD=How often seed data is written out to storage. Seed data is always written out on application shutdown.
SEED_STORAGE_PERIOD_ADD=An optional increase in the time between seed data writes. If the initial period was 5 seconds and the this was set to 2 seconds, writes would be separated by 5s, 7s, 9s, 11s and so on.
SEED_STORAGE_PERIOD_MULTIPLIER=An optional multiplicative increase in the time between data writes. If the initial period was 5 seconds and this was set to 2, writes would be separated by 5s, 10s, 20s, 40s and so on.
SEED_STORAGE_PERIOD_MAX=An optional maximum time between seed storage writes.
SEED_STORAGE_FILE=The file where seed data is stored if file storage is selected.
